**Automated Defect Detection** using computer vision and AI to monitor product quality during production in real time.
**Real-time Quality Reports** generated directly from the factory floor, alerting management to defects before they leave the production line.
**Supplier Quality Management** that tracks the quality of raw materials and components, ensuring they meet factory standards.

## Future Vision
- **Unified Platform with Modular Components:**
   - Rather than having separate apps, consider integrating all these functionalities into a **modular FactoryApp platform**. Users can enable or disable different modules (employee, machine, management, quality control) based on their specific needs.

- **Data-Driven Factory 4.0 Approach:**
   - Emphasize a **Factory 4.0 approach**, where everything is interconnected. Machines, employees, and management communicate seamlessly via IoT devices, providing **real-time data synchronization** and more **intelligent factory automation**.
  
- **Blockchain for Transparency**: 
   - For sensitive or high-value production processes, incorporate **blockchain** for secure, transparent records of employee attendance, machine status, and production output. This can also help with compliance and auditing.
